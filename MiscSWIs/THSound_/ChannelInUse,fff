{f25}Ü{f}	R0	Non-zero if a THSound sample is playing on specified channel.

This reads data from the SCCB to test whether a THSound voice is currently playing (it won't work for most other samples, because THSound uses the SCCB in a slightly non-standard way). The necessary information in the SCCB is invalid immediately after calling <Sound_Control=>OS:Sound_Control> and may wrongly show the channel not to be in use, so if you want to wait for a channel to become free you should use something like:

#fCode;indent 3;wrap off
  REM First wait for SCCB to be updated,
  REM   showing channel is in use
  REPEAT
   SYS"THSound_ChannelInUse",1 TO inuse%
  UNTIL inuse%
  REM Now wait until channel is free
  REPEAT
   SYS"THSound_ChannelInUse",1 TO inuse%
  UNTIL NOT inuse%
#wrap;indent;f

The second loop can be after, say, a <Wimp_Poll=>Wimp:Wimp_Poll>, but I suggest you put the first loop immediately after a <Sound_Control=>OS:Sound_Control> (or similar) instruction.
