It is recommended that sample data is kept in the RMA, using <OS_Module=>OS:OS_Module> for memory management (Archimedes), or in a <dynamic area=>OS:OS_DynamicArea> (Risc PC). Having sample data in application workspace could crash SoundDMA if the application is paged out eg by <Wimp_Poll=>Wimp:Wimp_Poll> while the sample is playing.

Each sample's voice is given the name THSVoice\<hh> where \<hh> is a unique hex code.
