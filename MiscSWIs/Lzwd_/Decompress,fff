LZWD_Decompress  (&CD100)
#Parent LZWD_
=>	R0 =	pointer to source filename
	R1 =	destination address
	R2 =	length of destination buffer

<=	R0 corrupted or error block pointer
	R2 =	length of bytes used in destination buffer
	all other registers preserved

This call is not provided in the main module but in the small, extra for demos or so written mini module LZWD. It is 25% faster than <LZW_Decompress>.
