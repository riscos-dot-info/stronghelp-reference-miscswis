Filer_KeyName
#Parent Filer_
=>	R0 =	<key code=>Wimp:Wimp_Poll8a>
<=	R0 =	pointer to key name

This SWI should really have been provided by the Toolbox, but since it isn't, I've put it in ProFiler. The reason for this SWI is to get a consistent naming of keys. It returns the name of the given key code.
