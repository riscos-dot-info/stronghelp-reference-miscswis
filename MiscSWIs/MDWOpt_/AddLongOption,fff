#line
Adds a long option descriptor to the buffer.

If R1 {f25}¹{f} 0, then the name is copied into the next free space in the strings buffer.

The space requirements for long options buffer are 16 bytes per entry, and 4 bytes for the end marker; you must set its first word to 0 before the first call to MDWOpt_AddLongOption.

The strings buffer, if you're using one (and you will if your program works in the same way as the example program), must have enough space for all of the option names plus the string terminators.
