Tracker_PlayNote  (&43209)
#Parent Tracker_
=>	R0 =	Sound channel to sound note on (1-8 max)
	R1 =	Tracker format note number (1-36)
	R2 =	Sample to play (1-36)
	R3 =	Volume (0-255) [Tracker volume even if soundtracker tune loaded].
\<=	R0-R3 preserved
	If tune not paused then C flag set otherwise C flag cleared.

If there is no tune loaded, an error will be generated.

It plays one of the samples which are part of the paused tune at a given pitch (1=low, 36=high) and volume (0=silent, 255=loud). If any of the values are out of range, an error will be reported.
The number of sound channels that can be used depends on the module loaded (soundtracker modules will always use 4 voices, whereas Tracker modules can use up to 8). Use <Tracker_TuneInfo> to find out the maximum number of voices if you intend to play more than one note at a time.

NB: This call should be avoided if possible, unless the purpose is to hear each sample seperately.
