Tracker_Load  (&43201)
#Parent Tracker_
=>	R0 =	pointer to filename of soundtracker/tracker module
\<=	R0 preserved

This call will claim memory from the RMA and load the specified tune module, initialise the sound system, and set the playroutine in pause mode. You must then use <Tracker_Play> to start the tune playing. The command *PlayMod calls this routine, and then <Tracker_Play>.

An error will be generated if the module cannot be loaded or not enough memory can be claimed.
