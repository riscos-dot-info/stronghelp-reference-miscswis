Tracker_SetPos  (&43207)
#Parent Tracker_
=>	R0 = New sequence position (0-127 max)
	R1 = Event (0-63 max)
\<=	R0 preserved

This performs the same actions as *PlayPos, except that the event with the pattern can be specified (0-63 normally). If an event number higher than the number of events in the current pattern is specified, the pattern will begin at event 0.

If there is no tune currently loaded, an error is generated.
