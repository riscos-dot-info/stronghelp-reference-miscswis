Tracker_Stop  (&43204)
#Parent Tracker_
This performs the same actions as *PlayStop. Using *PlayStop or this SWI is the only way to get the trackermodule to release the memory taken up by the tune module, or to force it to forget the address of a module if it has been loaded with <Tracker_MemoryLoad>. If the module is soundtracker and has been loaded with <Tracker_MemoryLoad>, calling this SWI or *PlayStop will convert the data back to the original format.
