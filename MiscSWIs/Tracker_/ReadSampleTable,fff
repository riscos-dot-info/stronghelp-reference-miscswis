#Parent Tracker_
=>	R0 =	Sample number (1-36)
\<=	R0 preserved
	R1 =	Pointer to sample name (0-terminated, max length 22 chars) 
	R2 =	Sample volume (0-255, 255=maximum volume, 0=silent) (or for sound tracker 0-64, 64=max vol.) 
	R3 =	Sample length (bytes)
	R4 =	Repeat offset (bytes)
	R5 =	Repeat length (bytes)
	R6 =	Address of raw sample data

This call returns all relevant information about the specified sample. 

If there is no tune loaded, an error will be generated.

If the sample number is out of range (for example, if reading sample 16 on a 15-instrument module), R1 and R6 will point to a zero, and R2-R5 will contain a zero.
