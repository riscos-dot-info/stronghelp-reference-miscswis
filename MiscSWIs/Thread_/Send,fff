*Notes*:	Sends the message, pointed to by R0, to the appropriate destination thread. The message block pointed to by R0 contains the following words:
 	 	1.	*reserved*
 	 	2.	*reserved*
 	 	3.	Source thread handle
 	 	4.	Destination thread handle
 	 	5.	Message number
 	 	6.	Data field
 	The *reserved* fields should be empty. The only field that must be filled in is the destination thread handle; the source thread handle will be useful, though, if the destination thread expects to be able toreply.
 	The message number and data fields of the message are both totally arbitrary values; there are no standards, it is up to the software author what to use. Several points must be observed:
 	 	1.	A message block can only exist in one thread's message queue
 	 	2.	A message block can only exist once in a given queue
 	 	3.	Messages can only be sent between the threads in the same task. If inter-task communication is required, use the Window Manager's own form of messaging. this could easily be extended to allow the encapsulation of a thread message within a WIMP message, should it be desired.
