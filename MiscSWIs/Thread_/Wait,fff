*Notes*:	Performs a Wait (decrement) operation on the given semaphore, if possible. If the operation causes the semaphore to go negative, the action can be twofold:
 	 	1.	If the pointer in R1 is NUL, then the thread will be suspended until the sempahore is signalled upon.
 	 	2.	If the pointer in R1 is not NUL, the word at the address will be filled with a boolean value indicating whether or not the Wait failed.
