*Notes*:	The thread that called the SWI receives a message from its incoming message list, if there is one present. If not, the action can be twofold:
 	 	1.	If the flag in R0 is NUL, then the thread will be suspended until a message arrives.
 	 	2.	If the flag in R0 is TRUE, then a NUL pointer will be returned in R0
