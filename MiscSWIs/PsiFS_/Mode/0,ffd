{f25}Ü{f}	Registers preserved
#line
This call closes any active connection and ends use of the configured block driver. This allows other programs to use the serial port. It is equivalent to using {fCode}*PsiFSDisable{f}.

If R1 is set to a non-zero value then PsiFS does not wait for data to be flushed, so may result in data being lost. It should only be used as a last resort.

No action is taken if the block driver is already disabled.
