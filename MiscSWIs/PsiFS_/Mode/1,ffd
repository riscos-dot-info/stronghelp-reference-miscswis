#line
This call activates the configured block driver and attempts to initiate a connection to a remote EPOC device using Psion Link Protocol. It is equivalent to using {fCode}*PsiFSEnable{f} with the -link switch.

If the block driver is already enabled then either no action is taken or an error is generated depending on whether the remote link is the current mode.
