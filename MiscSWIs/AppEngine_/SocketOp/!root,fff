This call provides operations to control file descriptors, which are requried to use the <Socket_Select=>InetSocket:Socket_Select> SWI.

A file descriptor is a block of 32 bytes (256 bits) which indicates which sockets should be checked for activity.

Note: The Acorn C Socket library provides equivalents of this SWI in headerfile macros.
