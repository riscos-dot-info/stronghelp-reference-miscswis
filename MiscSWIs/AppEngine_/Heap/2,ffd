AppEngine_Heap 2  (&4D949)
#Parent AppEngine_Heap
=>	R0 =	2
	R1 =	pointer to heap
	R2 =	size of block required (bytes)

<=	R1 =	pointer to anchor

This call is used to claim a block of memory from the heap.

The size of the block claimed will always be rounded up to at least the nearest multiple of four bytes.

The call returns a pointer to a word holding the address of the block, so in BASIC terms block_address%=!anchor%.  Blocks can move about in response to *any* heap operation, so you must ensure your block_address% is updated after any heap operation.
