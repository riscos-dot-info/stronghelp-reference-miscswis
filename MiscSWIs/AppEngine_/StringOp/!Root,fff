AppEngine_StringOp information
This call provides various operations to deal with ASCII strings.

Most (if not all) of the calls place their result within AppEngine's workspace and return a pointer to the string within the workspace.  For this reason, you must always copy the string to somewhere else before calling StringOp again - if you don't do that then further calls to StringOp will overwrite the workspace, destroying the string.

All strings are stored in the same style as BASIC, i.e. with CR (13) as the terminating character.  As with BASIC, they are limited to a maximum of 256 characters, including terminator (although this may change later on).  Typically you will use the operations in this way:
	
{fCode:SYS "AppEngine_StringOp",1,source% TO ,,string$}
	
Input strings can be terminated by any control character, unless otherwise stated.
