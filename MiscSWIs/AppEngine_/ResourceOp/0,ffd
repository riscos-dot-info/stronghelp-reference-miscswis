This call takes as input your applicationës directory variable and
returns a string with ê.Resources.\<Country>ë appended, where
\<Country> is the name of the currently configured territory.

A check is made to see if the desired resources are present.  If not,
then they are set to êUKë by default.

All country names are purposely truncated to a maximum of ten
characters.
