Decrunch_Decrunch (&C0AC0)
#Parent Decrunch_
=>	R0 =	<flags=>.flags>
	R1 =	pointer to filename, file handle, or source in memory as determined by flag bits 1 & 2
	R2 =	pointer to destination address, if forcing destination address (bit 4)

#Tab
\<=	if V set then
	  R0 =	pointer to <error block=>OS:swi_errorblock>
	  other registers preserved
	  file pointer unchanged (if using file handle)
	else
	  R0 preserved
	  R1 =	end of data, if reading from memory
	  	preserved, otherwise
	  R2 =	load address found in the source data
	  R3 =	length of uncrunched data
	  File pointer updated if reading from file

This SWI will decrunch crunched data. As the decompressor works in SVC mode, you can decrunch to a protected area of memory.
