*Use*:	After reading a message with <ARMEdit_TalkRX>, this call should be
used to claim the message, and to prevent it being offered to other
clients. This should be used before calling any other SWIs from this
module.
	If the message was sent by the ARMEdit module then calling this SWI
has no effect; other clients still receive the message.
