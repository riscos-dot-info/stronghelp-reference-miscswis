{f25}Þ{f}	R0 =	Client handle for this task.
{f25}Ü{f}	R0 !	Block containing waiting message, or 0 if no messages waiting.
	R1 =	Source ID.
	R2 =	Source client handle.
#line;tab
*Purpose*:	Check for any waiting messages for this client task.
*Interrupts*:	Interrupt status is undefined.
		Fast interrupts are enabled.
*Processor mode*:	Processor is in SVC mode.
{*}Re-entrancy{*}:	SWI is not re-entrant.
#wrap on
*Use*:	Check for any waiting messages. If none are available R0 contains 0
on exit, otherwise it contains a pointer to the first message. The
message should be checked, and if it is claimed <ARMEdit_TalkAck> or
<ARMEdit_TalkReply> should be called to prevent it being passed to
other clients. Any information required from the message must be read
or copied immediately, since the message could be overwritten by a
new message.
	The specified source client handle should be used for any reply;
unlike the ID it uniquely identifies a particular instantiation of a
client.
	If this call is successful then it should be called again; it is
possible for multiple messages to be pending for a single client.
