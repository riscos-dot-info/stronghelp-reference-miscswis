ARMEdit_TalkStart (&4BC41)
#parent ARMEdit_
{f25}Þ{f}	R0 =	Pre-allocated ID for this task.
	R1 =	<Flags=>.flags>
	R2 !	A function to be called when a message is available, or 0 for none.
	R3 =	Value for R12 to contain when function pointed to by R2 is called.
{f25}Ü{f}	R0 =	A unique client handle.
	R1 !	A poll word for this task.
#line;tab
*Purpose*:	Register a new client task.
*Interrupts*:	Interrupt status is undefined.
 	Fast interrupts are enabled.
*Processor mode*:	Processor is in SVC mode.
{*}Re-entrancy{*}:	SWI is not re-entrant.
*Use*:	An application that provides services to PC software should call this when it is starting. A message buffer is allocated and a unique handle for this task assigned. This handle should be stored and used in all other calls relating to this task.
	The poll word is initially set to zero. When there is potentially a message waiting for this task the poll word is set to a non-zero value. The poll word is cleared when either the message has been read, or no message is available for some other reason. *Note* that a non-zero poll word does not imply that a message will be available; another task might have read the message if it was not directed to a specific handle. The poll word must not be written to; it must only be modified by the ARMEdit module.
