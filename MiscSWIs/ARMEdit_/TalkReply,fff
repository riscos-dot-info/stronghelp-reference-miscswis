*Use*:	This is like <ARMEdit_TalkTX>, except that the message is stored in the
destination task's message buffer. The destination task must be
specified by it's client handle; it is not possible to send the
message to an ID.
	The main use of this call is to support the easy creation of RISC OS
tasks acting as a server for multiple PC tasks.
