Please include an SAE, coverage of return postage, and, if you want a new version of the software, a floppy disc. If any of these are missing, I may choose not to reply. Examples of postage coverage : sufficient Dutch stamps, IRC's, or small cash (e.g. £1). Never send any type of cheque. If you send a floppy disc, send a DD one, as I cannot yet handle HD discs on my Archimedes.

Please note I cannot hold on to floppy discs awaiting new versions of the software, i.e. always first check with me that there is a new version.
