Commands
#parent !Root
*RegisterModule \<module name> registers the given module for use by the caller. If this is the first registration for the module, a new entry for it is created in the database and its use count is set to 1. If the module is already registered, its use count is incremented.

*UnregisterModule \<module name> unregisters the given module for use by the caller. Its use count in the database is decremented. If the use count becomes 0, the module is deleted using SWI OS_Module 4. If the deletion fails, the module's entry in the database remains, with a use count of 0.

RegisteredModules will list all the registered modules and their use counts.

{*}The SWIs{*}
 	{f24}g{f}	"<ZeriRegister_RegisterModule>"
 	{f24}g{f}	"<ZeriRegister_UnregisterModule>"
These SWIs are used with r0 pointing to the module name and are fully equivalent to their corresponding *-command.

Module names may be terminated by a CTRL-character or a space, and any matches against the database are case insensitive. The exact name given during the first registration is the one stored in the database, and therefore the one listed by *RegisteredModules.
