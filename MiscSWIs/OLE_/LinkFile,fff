Adds a file to the 'watch list'. R0 points to an object name, this will be passed through <OS_GSTrans=>OS:OS_GSTrans> so system variable based paths can be used.

R1 holds the task's handle. Whenever a 'watched' file changes, this task will be sent a message informing it of the change. The <session number=>OLE_sessionnumber> in R2 will be part of that message, thus allowing a task to have multiple files watched over.
