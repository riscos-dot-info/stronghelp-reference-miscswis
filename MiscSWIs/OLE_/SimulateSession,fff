This SWI will create an OLEServer$ variable for the file type provided. It allows normal OLE protocols to be used by a client and simulates the actions required from a compliant application.

It should thus be used only for file types whose editing applications are known to be non-compliant with the protocols specified in OLESpec. ie. a client should check that no OLEServer$Type_XXX variable exists already before calling this swi.

Applications will automatically become compliant as servers by providing OLEServer$Type_XXX variables for their particular file types. A client will then pick the up necessary variable during the first variable scan and thus not call OLE_SimulateSession.
