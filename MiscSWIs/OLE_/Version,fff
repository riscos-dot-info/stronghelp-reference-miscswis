Returns the version number of this module. This is a useful SWI for checking to see if the module is loaded. If XSWI_OLEVersion returns an error then an application should call SWI <Wimp_StartTask=>Wimp:Wimp_StartTask> with "System:Modules.OLESupport" in R0 to start the link and embed manager.

Calling this when the manager is already running will cause it to be reinitialised and lose any linked files.

The major and minor revision numbers are taken from the module's version (0.24 at time of writing)
