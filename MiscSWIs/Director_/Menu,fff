Director command SWI equivilents
#Parent Director_
=>	R0 = pointer to line

The SWIs :
#Indent 2
<Director_Menu>
<Director_EndMenu>
<Director_Option>
<Director_Dash>
<Director_Command>
#Indent

are directly equivilent to their OSCLI command counterparts.

These are defined because processing star commands is very slow and in dynamic menus especially it is important that items can be added to menus quickly.
