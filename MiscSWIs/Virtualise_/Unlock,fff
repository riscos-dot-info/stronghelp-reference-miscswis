*Purpose*:	Unlock pages of a dynamic area for which virtual memory has been enabled.
*Interrupts*:	Interrupt status is undefined.
		Fast interrupts are enabled.
*Processor mode*:	Processor is in SVC mode.
{*}Re-entrancy{*}:	SWI is not re-entrant.
*Use*:	This SWI unlocks pages that were previously locked with <Virtualise_Lock>. Exactly the same values of R0 and R1 should be used when unlocking pages as were used when they were originally locked; unpredictable results might otherwise occur.
