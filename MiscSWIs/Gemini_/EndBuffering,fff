Gemini_EndBuffering (&4D507)
#parent Gemini_
=>	R1 =	pointer to <TMviewblock=>Gemini_viewblock>

This ends the bank switching, releasing (if any) the reserved memory and copying the contents of the second page (if the current page is the second) into the first.
#Line
To have a working engine with bank switching do this:

#Indent 2;fCode
SYS "<Gemini_StartBuffering>"
bank = 1
REPEAT
  bank = bank EOR 3
  SYS "<Gemini_Render>",,,,bank,0
UNTIL end
SYS "<Gemini_EndBuffering>"
#f;Indent

This will also work even if there isn't enough memory for bank switching.
