Gemini TMcolourblock
#Parent Gemini_
TMcolourblock (256 + 1024 * 4 bytes)
#Line
This contains all the colours used in the Gemini environment. They are stored separately, because Gemini recalculates them each time a user change graphic mode. The 1024*4 additional bytes are used to store a table of user defined lights. See later. Each colour entry uses 8 bytes; 4 for &BBGGRR00 of the colour and the second 4bytes to store the translated colour for the current graphic mode. The values inside [] are the default values set when you call <Gemini_Initialise>.

Once Gemini is running, if you want to change a colour (say the fog colour) just alter the relevant location with the new palette entry and then inform Gemini that you have changed colour by setting TMviewblock!156 to a value different from 0. Gemini will recalculate the new colour table next time a <Gemini_Render> call is issued and zeroes this location (+156) on exit.
