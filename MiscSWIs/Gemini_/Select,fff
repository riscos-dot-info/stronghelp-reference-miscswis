Gemini_Select (&4D508)
#Parent Gemini_
=>	R4 =	Reason code :
	 	1	Select all/only visible objects (the ones inside working area)
	 	2	<Select the specified group of objects=>.two>
	 	3	Select all the points inside the specified rectangle
	 	4	Select/find the point closest to the passed (X,Y) screen coordinates
	 	5	<Select/find the primitive closest to the passed (X,Y) screen coordinates=>.five>
	 	16	Deselect all/only visible objects
	 	17	<Deselect the specified group of objects=>.two>
	 	18	Deselect all the points inside the specified rectangle
	Other registers dependant on reason code.

This is a multi-purpose selection command.  Its behaviour depends upon the reason code passed in R4.
#Subpage two
Gemini_Select 2 (or 17)
=>	R0 =	pointer to <TMmemoryblock=>Gemini_memoryblock>
	R2 =	logical number of the group to select/deselect
	R4 =	2 to select, 17 to deselect
#Subpage five
Gemini_Select 5
=>	R0 =	pointer to <TMmemoryblock=>Gemini_memoryblock>
	R1 =	pointer to <TMviewblock=>Gemini_viewblock>
	R2 =	X (OS units relative to the whole screen, e.g. mouse X coordinate)
	R3 =	Y (as above)
	R4 =	5
	R5 =	flag: if bit 0 is set, then Gemini will check only visible primitives
