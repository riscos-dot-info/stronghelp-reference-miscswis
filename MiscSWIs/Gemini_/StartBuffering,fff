This tries to reserve enough video memory to obtain a second bank to enable screen banking for smooth animation. If it succeeds, then it copies the first page into the second, to enable a bank switching also from desktop (the second page isn't filled with strange colours this way...). Otherwise nothing happens and Gemini will use the current video memory.
