Gemini_Render (&4D505)
#Parent Gemini_
=>	R0 =	pointer to <TMmemoryblock=>Gemini_memoryblock>
	R1 =	pointer to <TMviewblock=>Gemini_viewblock>
	R2 =	pointer to <TMcolourblock=>Gemini_colourblock>
	R3 =	screen bank to use (1 or 2; 1 for default)
	R4 =	<rendering mode=>.mode>

Gemini enables you to have a full double buffering for smooth animation. Just redraw the screen with R3 set to 1 or 2 alternatively. See <Gemini_EndBuffering>.
