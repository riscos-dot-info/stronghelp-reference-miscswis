Menu Modification
You can in any moment change menu title string as well as the text of menu items. You can also change foreground and background colours of menu items.
                                              
Menu item has a number of flags which control its appearance and behaviour. The flags are <tick=>MenuUtil_Tick>, <fade=>MenuUtil_Fade>, <dots=>MenuUtil_Dots>, <submenu=>MenuUtil_SubMenu>, <writable=>MenuUtil_Writable> and <message=>MenuUtil_Warning>. Special SWIs are provided to set or clear each menu flag. As a special case when you are making menu item writable you can also specify buffer size and optional <validation string=>Wimp:Wimp_validationstring>. 

You can delete single menu item or the whole menu with <MenuUtil_Delete>. You can also recursively delete the whole menu subtree connected with the deleted item or with the deleted menu.
