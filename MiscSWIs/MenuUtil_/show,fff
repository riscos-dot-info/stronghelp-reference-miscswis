#Parent MenuUtil_

	R1 {f25}®{f}	block or 0
{f25}Ü{f}	R0,R1	preserved
#Line
*Use*:	This call may be used to display menu on screen. Screen position for menu will be calculated according to rules described in PRM. Block pointed to by R1 must contain the same information as returned by <Wimp_Poll=>Wimp:Wimp_Poll> in case of mouse click event (in fact only mouse coordinates and window handle will be used) :

	 	R1 + 0	mouse X
	 	R1 + 4	mouse Y
	 	R1 + 8	buttons
	 	R1 +12	window handle (-2 if icon bar)
	 	R1 +16	icon handle                

	MenuUtils automatically distinguishes iconbar menus from ordinary window menus. If menu is already on screen and you want to reopen it after user selection with Adjust button then pointer to the block may be omitted.
