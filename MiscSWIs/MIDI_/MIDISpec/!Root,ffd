#f12:MIDI Interface Data Specification

#align
MIDI instruments contain a receiver and a transmitter, the receiver being optoisolated. It interprets and acts on MIDI commands. The transmitter sends messages in MIDI format via a line driver.

The MIDI data rate is 31.25 Kbaud (±1%) asynchronous. MIDI bytes are 10 bits long, consisting of a start bit, eight data bits and a stop bit.
