MIDI_Interface (&404E4)
#parent MIDI_
=>	No entry conditions.

<=	R0		=	workspace pointer, moved to R12 when calling a SWI through this interface.

	R1 		=	SWI code pointer.

Returns addresses for more efficient access to critical SWIs.

When calling SWIs using this interface, the CPU should be in SVC mode.

The MIDI SWIs are not re-entrant so they should not be called from an interrupt routine. R1 should contain the SWI offset from the chunk base (<MIDI_SoundEnable> = 0). R0 should contain the workspace pointer. The addresses become invalid if the MIDI module is reinitialised or finalised, so watch for <MIDI service calls=>Service.Menu> to warn of this, and recall this SWI.
