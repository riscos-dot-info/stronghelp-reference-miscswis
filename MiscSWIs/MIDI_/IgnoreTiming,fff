MIDI_IgnoreTiming (&404DF)
#parent MIDI_
=>	R0	= 0 receive messages normally (default)
	 	= 1 ignore recieved timing messages

Instructs the system to ignore or take notice of received tiing messages.

There is a subtle distinction between the mode set by this SWI, where received Timing messages are completely ignored, and the mode set by calling <MIDI_Init> with bit 31 set, which only disables special actions on Timing Message reception. The messages may still be stored in the receive buffer in the latter case, if <MIDI_Init> is called with bit 30 set, but not if Ignore Timing mode is set.
