MIDI_InqError (&404C6)
#parent MIDI_
=>	No entry conditions.

<=	R0	=		up to four error bytes, one byte per installed MIDI port.
	 	0 (zero)	No error.
	 	'A' (65)	Active Sensing failure. MIDI connection removed or Active Sensing transmission was stopped by the transmitter)
	 	'B' (66)	Receive data FIFO was (and still may be) full and data has been lost. The application should take the data more quickly.
	 	'O' (79)	UART overrun. The received data arrived but was not read from the UART receive register before it was overwritten by the next incoming byte. This might happen when there is a lot of other processing occurring with the processor interrupt flag clear. High bandwith screen modes with simultaneous sound and other intensive processor activity might also occasionally cause this error.
	 	'F' (70)	Framing error. This is generated by the UART when serial data arrives which does not fit the expectd protocol, ie is not sensible MIDI data.
	 	'L' (76)	Note too low (or too high) for the internal sound system received by the interpreter and ignored. The lowest note that the sound system can make is the C four octaves below middle C, or MIDI value 12. The highest note is MIDI value 96, or three octaves above middle C.
	 	'T' (84)	Transmit data FIFO has buffer has overflowed and data to be transmitted has been lost. The application should transmit data more slowly or use <MIDI_InqBufferSize>.
	 	'V' (86)	Received MIDI data has caused the interpreter to attempt to use more than eight voices of the internal sound system, which are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

Return the value of the MIDI error bytes.

Only the last error is shown; previous errors are overwritten.
Overrun and framing errors are alos returned as standard SWI errors by <MIDI_RxCommand> and <MIDI_RxByte> at the time they read the corrupted byte.
The error is cleared when read.
