=>	R0	= 0	 	perform Internal System Reset (reset to power-on state).
	 	> 0	bit 0	set to clear current transmitted running status (ensure status is included with next transmitted message).
	 	 	bit 1	set to clear receive buffers and reset MIDI interpreter.
	 	 	bit 2	set to clear transmit buffers and reset MIDI interpreter.
	 	 	bit 3	set to clear MIDI scheduler.
	 	 	bit 4	set to clear current error (special mode bits are only cleared by an Internal System Reset).
	 	 	bit 30	set to enable special mode so that System Real Time messages will be stored in the receive buffer, so that they can be read with <MIDI_RxCommand> and <MIDI_RxByte>.
	 	 	bit 31	set to prevent special actions on receipt of System Real Time messages. Use <MIDI_IgnoreTiming> in preference to this to just cause Timing messages to be ignored.

<=	R1	=	 	number of recognised MIDI ports installed.
	 	 	 	Subtract one from this number for the maximum port number.

Certain MIDI recording and replaying applications may need to set bits 30 and 31 so that they can precisely reproduce the recorded data with the Real Time messages.
