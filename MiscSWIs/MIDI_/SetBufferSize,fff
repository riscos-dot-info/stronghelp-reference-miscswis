MIDI_SetBufferSize (&404E3)
#parent MIDI_
=>	R0	= 0	for setting receive buffer size (nothing else currently supported).

	R1	=	new buffer size in bytes.
	 	= 0	to read current buffer size.

<=	R0	=	buffer size in bytes

	R1	=	total space in bytes claimed from the RMA for new buffers.
	 	=	5 x size x number of MIDI ports installed for receive buffer (for each byte received, four bytes of time stamp information is also stored).

Clears the buffer and then claims the requested buffer size from the RMA. Returns a {Fcode:No room in RMA} error (&102) if unable to claim the new buffers, and leaves the previous buffer intact. This call should only be used when the buffers are empty, otherwise data will be lost.

Use <MIDI_Init> with bits 1 and 2 of R0 set to just clear the buffers.
