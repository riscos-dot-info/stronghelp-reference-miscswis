=>	R0 =	<Drawing style=>.drawingstyle>
 	R1 !	Picture structure or zero.
 	R2 =	Offset of 3D origin from screen origin X.
 	R3 =	Offset of 3D origin from screen origin Y.
 	R4 !	String (possibly null) for camera name or zero.
 	R5 !	VDU variables block. (See 'Experts').

This call is the fundamental one to get a picture on the screen. It has been designed for use with the Wimp (hence the origin offset parameters).
