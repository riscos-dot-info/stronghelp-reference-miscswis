Euclid_Destroy (&80647)
=>	R1 !	Picture structure or zero.
 	R2 !	Object to destroy.
<=	-
#line;wrap on
This is the complement of <Euclid_Create>. It will remove a whole block from
the picture structure, relocating all pointers after compacting the
structure back down. If pointers are found which are pointing to the block
you are trying to destroy, then they are set to zero. Note however that the
entries which contain these pointers are not themselves deleted. Any
pointers which you hold should be adjusted if they point above the block in
question - the adjustment being to subtract the destroyed block's size.
