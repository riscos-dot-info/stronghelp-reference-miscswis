Euclid_Set (&80646)
#parent Euclid_
=>	R0 =	Entry number (0 = header).
 	R2 !	Object to set entry in.
 	R3-R7 =	Relevant data for object header or variable section.
<=	-
#line
R3 to R7 contain data to overwrite the data currently in the object whose pointer is in R2. If R0 is zero the object's header is altered. If R0 is non-zero then the nth variable section is altered. If, for example, the variable section is only 8 bytes in length, then only R3 and R4 would be used.

As a special case, if the object's header contains a name (e.g. for a Group/Solid) then R3 is taken as a pointer to a string, and R4-R7 will set the bounding sphere. If R3 is zero, then the name remains intact.
