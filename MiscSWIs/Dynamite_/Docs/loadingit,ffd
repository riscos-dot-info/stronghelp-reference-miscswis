Dynamite should normally be loaded from an Obey file in the following way:

#wrap off;fCode
RMEnsure Dynamite 0.00 RMRun \<My$Dir\>.Dynamite
RMEnsure Dynamite 1.11 Error 0 Dynamite module is too old
#f;wrap on

It is *important* to note that the Dynamite module must be RMRun, not just RMLoaded ˜ this will ensure that the Dynamite WIMP task is started correctly.
