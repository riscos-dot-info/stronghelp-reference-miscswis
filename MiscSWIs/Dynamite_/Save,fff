Dynamite_Save (SWI &4A3C7)
#parent Dynamite_
{*}Dynamite_Save{*}	Saves some registers on Dynamite's relocation stack
On entry	R0 =	bit mask of registers to save
	Other registers as described below
On exit	˜
Interrupts	Interrupt status is not defined
	Fast interrupts are enabled
Processor mode	Processor is in SVC mode
Re-entrancy	SWI is not re-entrant
Use	This SWI will save the registers specified in R0 on Dynamite's relocation stack.  R0 should contain a bit set for each register that you want saved ˜ i.e.  bit 1 set to save R1, etc.
	You cannot usefully save R9-R15 or R0, so the corresponding bits of R0 should not be set on entry.
	The stack is ascending, and follows the normal ARM rules for ascending stacks.  Hence if you save R1-R7 on the stack, the saved R7 will be the first register to be removed.
	The upper two bytes of R0 are ignored by this SWI.  Therefore R0 on entry can actually contain an STM instruction specifying the required registers.
