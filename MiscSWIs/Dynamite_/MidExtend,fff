Dynamite_MidExtend (SWI &4A3C6)
#parent Dynamite_
{*}Dynamite_MidExtend{*}	Inserts or deletes bytes at a given offset within a block
On entry	R0 =	address of block anchor
	R1 =	offset within block to add or remove bytes
	R2 =	signed number of bytes to add
On exit	R0 preserved
	R1 =	address of block, which may have moved
Interrupts	Interrupt status is not defined
	Fast interrupts are enabled
Processor mode	Processor is in SVC mode
Re-entrancy	SWI is not re-entrant
Use	This call will, depending on whether R2 is positive or negative, insert or remove bytes from a Dynamite block starting at the offset given in R1.  This may of course cause the block's size to change. Always after a call to Dynamite_MidExtend, the data that was previously at offset R1 is moved to offset R1+R2.
	The diagrams below show the effects of inserting or removing bytes from a block:

	This SWI may cause blocks to move within the Dynamite heap.
