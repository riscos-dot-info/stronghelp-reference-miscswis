Users_SetUID
#Parent Users_
=>	R0 =	uid number
	R1 =	pointer to password, or 0 to ignore password

This SWI is used to set the current process' uid. If the password is incorrect, or the user is not root then this call will cause an error, leaving the user in the previous uid. The {fCode}su{f} command uses this call to change uid's.
