This SWI allows you to play any of the 64 samples held in the QTM sample table on any of the 4 or 8 available channels. A sample can be played at any time, including while a song is playing, although the sample may be cut short if the song is playing. Playing a non-existent sample will result in nothing being played. The samples above 31 can be used after they are registered, using <QTM_RegisterSample>.

This SWI will also start up the QTM sound system if it is called while the
song is stopped or paused, though it will not switch the system off after
the sample finishes, use <QTM_SoundControl> to do this.

V flag set if any of the registers contain illegal values.
