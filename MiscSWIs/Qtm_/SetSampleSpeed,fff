QTM_SetSampleSpeed  (&47E49)
#Parent QTM_
=>	R0 =	new sample speed (16-96µS) or -1 to read current speed
<=	R0 =	previous sample speed (16-96µS)

This SWI lets you set the time between sample outputs (ie. sample quality) to a value between 16µS and 96µS. Smaller speed values give better sample quality, but also use more processor time, slowing the computer down more. The default speed is 32µS.

Note: If 8 channels are enabled, the minimum sample speed is 24µS.

V flag set if sample speed is out of range
