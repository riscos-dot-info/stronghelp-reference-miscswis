=>	R0 =	<channel number=>.usrchannel> to alter
	 	or 0 for <pre-programmed settings=>.prgchannel>

<=	R0 is preserved
	If R0 = 1-8 then R1 = previous stereo position
	If R0 = 0 then R1 is corrupted

This SWI allows the stereo positions for each channel to be altered independently, or all together. If R0=1-8 on entry, then R1 must be either a valid stereo position (-127 to 127) or -128 to read the previous position. If R0=0 on entry, then R1 must be in the range 0-4 to alter all the channels to one of these pre-programmed values.
