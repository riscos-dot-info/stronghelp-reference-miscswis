<=	R0 =	current song speed (00-31)
	R1 =	current song CIA tempo setting (32-255)
	R2 =	speed counter value (01-speed)

This SWI returns information on the current speed, tempo and counter values of the current song. The speed value (R0) is the number of times the song controller has to be called, before it plays the next note, the default is 6 times. If a speed of 0 is returned, the song is not playing.

The CIA tempo setting controls how fast the song controller is called. The default is 50 times a second, tempo 125. (The name CIA tempo comes from Complex Interface Adaptor, which was used on the Amiga to control ProTracker's interrupt speed.)

The speed counter (R2) varies from 1 to the current speed (R0). It is decremented once every time the song controller is called, until it reaches 0, when the next note is played and the counter is reset to the speed.

V flag set if no song is loaded
