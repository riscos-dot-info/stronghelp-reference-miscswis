This SWI provides user control over the speed of the currently playing song. This command has the same effect (and takes the same parameters) as the speed-change 'F' effect as used in ProTracker compatible songs. The only difference being that a value of 0 will NOT stop the song, use SWI QTM_Stop to do this.

After using this SWI, the song speed will remain at the new value until an 'F' effect is played, or the song is stopped. Note: if the 'F' effect is disabled, using <QTM_EffectControl>, the song will play at the new speed until it is stopped, or 'F' effects are enabled again.

The current speed and tempo can be read using <QTM_ReadSpeed>.

V flag set if no song loaded or the new speed/tempo is out of range.
