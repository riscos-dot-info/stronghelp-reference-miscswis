QTM_DMABuffer  (&47E4A)
#Parent QTM_
<=	R0 =	address of last used DMA sound buffer.

By using this SWI, it would be possible to implement sound output oscilloscopes, or volume activated (real) VU bars. The data in the DMA buffer is stored as: [c1],[c2],[c3],[c0],[c1],[c2]...etc, 1 byte for each channel. The DMA buffer size used by QTM is 208*\<no. of channels> long.

The address returned in R0 will only be accurate if the QTM sound system is currently active. To check whether this is the case, use <QTM_SoundControl>, to read the sound system state (number of channels).
