QTM_SWITableAddress  (&47E59)
#Parent QTM_
<=	R0 = address of QTM's internal SWI jump table

This SWI returns the address of QTM's SWI jump table, so that user programs can call directly any QTM SWI, without going through the RiscOS SWI handler.

To call a QTM SWI via this address, the registers should be set up as required by the SWI, and the SWI number minus &47E40 should be placed in R11. The SWI can then be executed by branching to this SWI table address.

Note: all QTM SWIs can be called this way, from any PSR mode, although if the QTM sound system is active, <QTM_RemoveChannel> should be called from a non-User mode, to allow disabling of interrupts.
