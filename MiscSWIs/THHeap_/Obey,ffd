THHeap Obey File Syntax
#Parent THHeap:!Root

{*}Obey file syntax{*}

It is recommended that the Obey file sequence to load THHeap is based on the following:

#fCode;indent 3;Wrap off
Set AppName$THHeap \<App$Dir\>.THHeapR
RMEnsure UtilityModule 3.50 Set AppName$THHeap \<App$Dir\>.THHeapA
RMEnsure THHeap 0.00 RMLoad \<Appname$THHeap\>
Unset AppName$THHeap
RMEnsure THHeap 1.21 Error 0 You need THHeap 1.21 or later
#Wrap;indent;f

Note this is slightly different to before, because a change in implementation means that loading a new version of THHeap while some applications are using an older one is likely to cause a crash.
