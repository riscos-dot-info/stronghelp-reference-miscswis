THHeap_CreateHeap (&4C680)
#Parent THHeap_
{f25}Þ{f}	R0 !	Name to give dynamic area
{f25}Ü{f}	R0 = 	Heap reference ('handle')
#line
Restrict the dynamic area name to a length suitable for the Task Manager window. Use the returned handle in all subsequent calls using this heap.

It is advised that you *do not use* this SWI, since it places no restriction on the size of a Dynamic Area, which could lead to a lack of address space being available for other applications.

The new SWI is <THHeap_CreateLimited>.
