#Parent THHeap_
{f25}Þ{f}	R0 !	Name to give dynamic area

This call performs a similar function to <THHeap_CreateHeap> but allows a maximum size to be set for the dynamic area to grow to, to avoid hogging address space.

It calls <THHeap_CreateGranular> with a granularity value of 3.

Restrict the dynamic area name to a length suitable for the Task Manager window. Use the returned handle in all subsequent calls using this heap.
