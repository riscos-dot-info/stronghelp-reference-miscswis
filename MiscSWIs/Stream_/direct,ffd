Direct stream drivers
#Parent Stream_
VduStream 1.09 onwards provides direct stream access so that applications can send text to the stream when the operating system <OS:OS_WriteC> is being intercepted by someone else earlier in the chain. eg during printing.

The following direct swis are provided:
#Indent 1
Stream_WriteC	: Write R0 charater to the stream
Stream_Write0	: Write null terminated string. R0=ptr
Stream_WriteS	: Write in line string.
Stream_WriteN	: Write counted string. R0=ptr, R1=number
Stream_NewLine	: Write newline

Stream_WriteTxx	: Write r0 as characters. "." replaces non-alphanumeric
Stream_WriteHxx	: Write hex conversion of R0
Stream_WriteDxx	: Write decimal conversion of R0
Stream_WriteBxx	: Write binary conversion of R0

#Indent
Where xx is 32, 24, 16, or 8 depending on the number of bits to display.
