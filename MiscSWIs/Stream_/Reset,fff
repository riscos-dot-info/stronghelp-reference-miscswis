Stream_Reset (&81948)
#Parent Stream_
No parameters

Throws away all stacked calls to <Stream_Enable> and releases the WrchV. This should be used incase of emmergency. (ie when a client application has crashed and not called <Stream_Disable>. You will notice this by error boxes with no text in them appearing along with the desktop rendering sprites only)
